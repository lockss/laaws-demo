LAAWS Demo</h1>
<a href="http://blog.dshr.org/2016/03/talk-on-evolving-lockss-technology-at.html">LAAWS
(LOCKSS Architected As Web Services)</a> is an on-going program to restructure the LOCKSS
software into a collection of cooperating REST-ful Web services.
As a demonstration of the current state of the LAAWS program, here is a live demo of the
LAAWS software.<br />
<p>
The demo contains issues of three Creative Commons licensed journals collected by the
classic LOCKSS daemon and exported as WARC files via the classic LOCKSS daemon's WARC
exporter.
These WARC files were ingested into the LAAWS repository, which is a native WARC
repository implemented as a REST-ful Web service.
Their bibliographic metadata was extracted by the LAAWS metadata extraction Web service.
The SOLR search engine indexed their text.
The only area of this demo in which code from the classic LOCKSS daemon is still used
is as a framework allowing the metadata services to access the LOCKSS
plugins describing the journal content.<br />
<p>
Still to come are the LOCKSS Audit and Repair Protocol and the LOCKSS crawler.<br />
<p>
This page allows you to search these issues via DOI, OpenURL and full-text search,
each of which is implemented as a REST-ful Web API.<br />
<p>
Partial funding for LAAWS was generously provided by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.<br />
